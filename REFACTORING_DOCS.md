## ?? Getting Started

### Recommended Workflow

**Week 1**: Foundation
```bash
# Day 1-2: Set up testing
- Follow QUICK_START.md steps 1-2
- Create test project
- Write first tests for CalendarEngine

# Day 3-4: First refactoring
- Follow QUICK_START.md steps 3-5
- Extract ILayoutCalculator
- Write tests, refactor existing code

# Day 5: Create services
- Complete Task 1.1: IDialogService
- Complete Task 1.2: INavigationService
```

**Week 2**: Rendering Logic
```bash
# Extract rendering logic (Phase 2)
- Create ICalendarRenderer
- Create IImageProcessor
- Write comprehensive tests
```

**Week 3**: DesignerPage Refactoring
```bash
# Refactor DesignerPage (Phase 3)
- Create DesignerViewModel
- Extract GestureHandler
- Reduce code-behind to <300 lines
```

Continue following the phases in order...
